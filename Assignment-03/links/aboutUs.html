    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      rom humble beginnings as a small fishing village first documented in the
      18th century, the city grew rapidly as it became a major centre of the
      pearl-diving industry. With its business-savvy ruling family reducing
      taxes and welcoming foreign merchants, the city expanded further in the
      early 20th century and soon became a re-exporting hub for Persia and
      India. Benefiting from modest oil wealth in the latter half of the 20th
      century, Dubai continued to focus on trade and attracting investment,
      channelling oil surpluses into major infrastructure projects such as an
      international airport, dry docks, and a trade centre. In the 1990s the
      city began to diversify, building up its luxury tourism, real estate, and
      financial sectors. These all required skilled, educated foreign workers,
      and many moved to Dubai for its tax-free salaries and relatively stable
      politics. With expatriates coming from elsewhere in the Arab world as well
      as from Asia, Europe, and North America, the city took on a rather
      cosmopolitan air and was considered to have one of the most liberal
      societies in the region.

    <p>
      Burj Khalifa, mixed-use skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that is
      the world’s tallest building, according to all three of the main criteria
      by which such buildings are judged (see Researcher’s Note: Heights of
      Buildings). Burj Khalifa (“Khalifa Tower”), known during construction as
      Burj Dubai, was officially named to honour the leader of the neighbouring
      emirate of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zayed Al Nahyan. Although the
      tower was formally opened on January 4, 2010, the entirety of the interior
      was not complete at that time. Built to house a variety of commercial,
      residential, and hospitality ventures, the tower—whose intended height
      remained a closely guarded secret throughout its construction—reached
      completion at 163 floors and a height of 2,717 feet (828 metres). It was
      designed by the Chicago-based architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &
      Merrill. Adrian Smith served as architect, and William F. Baker served as
      structural engineer.
      <br /><br /><br />
      The building, modular in plan, is laid out on a three-lobed footprint that
      is an abstract rendering of the local Hymenocallis flower. The Y-shaped
      plan plays a central role in the reduction of wind forces on the tower. A
      hexagonal central core is buttressed by a series of wings, each with its
      own concrete core and perimeter columns. As the tower increases in height,
      the wings step back in a spiral configuration, changing the building’s
      shape at each tier and so reducing the effect of the wind on the building.
      The central core emerges at the tower’s top and is finished with a spire,
      which reaches more than 700 feet (200 metres). The spire was constructed
      inside the tower and hoisted to its final position using a hydraulic pump.
      At the foundational level, the tower is supported by a reinforced concrete
      mat nearly 13 feet (4 metres) thick, itself supported by concrete piles 5
      feet (1.5 metres) in diameter. A three-story podium anchors the tower in
      place; the podium and two-story basement alone measure some 2,000,000
      square feet (186,000 square metres) in their own right. The tower’s
      exterior cladding is made up of aluminum and stainless-steel panels,
      vertical stainless-steel tubular fins, and more than 28,000 hand-cut glass
      panels. A public observation deck, called “At the Top,” is located on the
      124th floor.
      <br /><br /><br />Upon its inauguration in January 2010, Burj Khalifa
      easily surpassed the Taipei 101 (Taipei Financial Center) building in
      Taipei, Taiwan, which measured 1,667 feet (508 metres), as the world’s
      tallest building. At the same time, Burj Khalifa broke numerous other
      records, including the world’s tallest freestanding structure, the world’s
      highest occupied floor, and the world’s highest outdoor observation deck.
