          Dubai is located on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula in the
          southwest corner of the Arabian Gulf. Dubai is the second largest
          emirate in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) sharing borders with Abu
          Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast, and the Sultanate of
          Oman in the southeast.

    <!-- Introduction -->

    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Dubai, city and capital of the emirate of Dubai, one of the wealthiest of
      the seven emirates that constitute the federation of the United Arab
      Emirates, which was created in 1971 following independence from Great
      Britain. There are several theories about the origin of the name Dubai.
      One associates it with the daba—a type of locust that infests the
      area—while another holds that it refers to a market that existed near the
      city. In recent years Dubai has been compared to
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Singapore" target="_blank"
        >Singapore</a
      >
      and Hong Kong and is often regarded as the Middle East’s premier entrepôt.
      Area 13.5 square miles (35 square km). Pop. (2017 est.) 2,919,178. Dubai,
      constituent emirate of the United Arab Emirates (formerly Trucial States
      or Trucial Oman). The second most populous and second largest state of the
      federation (area 1,510 square miles [3,900 square km]), it is roughly
      rectangular, with a frontage of about 45 miles (72 km) on the Persian
      Gulf. The emirate’s capital, also named Dubai, is the largest city of the
      federation. The city is located on a small creek in the northeast part of
      the state. More than nine-tenths of the emirate’s population lives in the
      capital and nearby built-up sections. Dubai is surrounded by Abu Dhabi
      emirate on the south and west and by Sharjah emirate on the east and
      northeast. In addition, the small exclave (detached section) of
      Al-Ḥajarayn in the Wadi Ḥattā, more than 25 miles (40 km) from the nearest
      territory of Dubai proper, belongs to the state.
      <br /><br /><br />
      The settlement of Dubai town is known from 1799. The sheikh (Arabic:
      shaykh) of the emirate, then a minor, signed the British-sponsored General
      Treaty of Peace (1820), but the area was seemingly dependent on Abu Dhabi
      until 1833. In that year a group of Āl Bū Falāsah clansmen of the Banū Yās
      confederation, chiefly pearl fishers, left Abu Dhabi in a rivalry dispute
      and took over Dubai town without resistance. From then on, Dubai became,
      by local standards, a powerful state. It was frequently at odds with Abu
      Dhabi’s rulers and the Qawāsim (Āl Qāsimī), who controlled the area just
      north of Dubai, both of whom tried to take control of it, but Dubai’s new
      rulers retained their independence by playing the neighbouring sheikhdoms
      against each other. Together with the rest of the original Trucial States,
      the emirate signed with Britain a maritime truce in 1835 and the Perpetual
      Maritime Truce in 1853. Its foreign relations were placed under British
      control by the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. When Britain finally left the
      Persian Gulf in 1971, Dubai was a prominent founding member of the United
      Arab Emirates.
      <br /><br /><br />
      The Maktoum sheikhs of Dubai, unlike most of their neighbours, long
      fostered trade and commerce; Dubai was an important port by the beginning
      of the 20th century. Many foreign merchants (chiefly Indians) settled
      there; until the 1930s it was known for pearl exports. More recently,
      Dubai has become the region’s chief port for the import of Western
      manufactures. Most of the United Arab Emirates’ banks and insurance
      companies are headquartered there. After the devaluation of the gulf rupee
      (1966), Dubai joined the country of Qatar in setting up a new monetary
      unit, the riyal. In 1973 Dubai joined the other emirates in the adoption
      of a national currency, the dirham. The emirate has free trade in gold,
      and there is a brisk smuggling trade in gold ingots to India, where gold
      imports are restricted.
    </p>
    <h3>Character of the city</h3>
    <p>
      Dubai is a city of
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/skyscraper" target="_blank"
        >skyscrapers</a
      >, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside
      sun-seeking tourism. Because of its large expatriate population, it feels
      like a Middle Eastern melting pot, and the atmosphere is generally
      tolerant. Religious affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life.
      Islam is the majority religion, but churches and Hindu temples coexist
      with Dubai’s mosques. Exploring the expansive cityscape of Dubai Exploring
      the expansive cityscape of Dubai Overview of Dubai city, United Arab
      Emirates.See all videos for this article Dubai is a relatively crime-free
      place where administrative efficiency and openness to business have
      encouraged astounding growth. However, criticism of Dubai’s authoritarian
      government and ruling elite is not tolerated, and there persists an
      atmosphere of discreet corruption. <br /><br /><br />
      In 1966 the offshore oil field of Fatḥ (Fateh) was discovered in the
      Persian Gulf about 75 miles (120 km) due east of Dubai, in waters where
      the state had granted an oil concession. By the 1970s three 20-story
      submarine tanks, each holding 500,000 barrels, were installed on the
      seabed at the site. Shaped like inverted champagne glasses, they are
      popularly called the “Three Pyramids of Dubai.” Dubai’s estimated oil
      reserves are less than one-twentieth those of neighbouring Abu Dhabi, but
      oil income combined with trading wealth has made Dubai a very prosperous
      state. A number of industrial plants, including an aluminum smelter and an
      associated natural gas fractionator, were built in the late 1970s. Since
      the late 1980s aluminum production has greatly increased through a number
      of staged expansions of the smelter’s facilities.
      <br /><br /><br />
      Dubai has concentrated on a wide range of development and construction
      plans designed to promote tourism, transport, and industry. Port Rashid (a
      deepwater harbour named for the former emir) was opened there in 1972, and
      a supertanker dry dock was completed in 1979. In an effort to boost
      industrial investment, the Jebel Ali port and industrial centre was
      declared a free-trade zone in the early 1980s; the move was largely
      successful, and numerous international companies responded favourably by
      opening facilities there. The project of overseeing Port Rashid and Jebel
      Ali was taken over in the early 1990s by the Dubai Ports Authority, which
      was created for the task. The emirate is served by Dubai International
      airport; Emirate Airlines, the national carrier of the United Arab
      Emirates, was established by the Dubai government in the mid-1980s. In
      September 2009 the first portion of a driverless rapid-transit metro line,
      the first in the gulf region, went into operation in Dubai.
      <br /><br /><br />
      In the early 21st century a range of transportation and construction
      projects were under way, including light- and urban-rail systems, a sports
      complex, luxury hotels, and island developments. Though interrupted by
      strikes held by the city’s large population of expatriate labourers,
      construction on the Burj Dubai tower (“Dubai Tower”), as it was then
      known, was ongoing. Although the building’s interior was not entirely
      complete, upon its official opening in January 2010—as Burj Khalifa—it was
      easily the world’s tallest building and its tallest freestanding
      structure. Investment in the tower and numerous other extravagant projects
      entailed heavy borrowing, however, and with the escalation of the global
      financial crisis of the previous years, the emirate’s economy was troubled
      by massive debt and substantial quantities of real estate that lacked
      prospective buyers. New reliance upon neighbouring Abu Dhabi—which had
      recently provided its financially troubled neighbour with a bailout of
      some $10 billion—explains to some extent the surprise decision to rename
      the Burj Dubai in honour of Abu Dhabi’s emir, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zayed Al
      Nahyan, upon its opening. Pop. (2020 est.) emirate, 3,411,200.

    <!-- Landscape -->
    <h1 id="landscape">Landscape</h1>
    <p>
      The western area of Dubai benefits from small stretches of sandy beaches,
      which have helped to catalyze the city’s tourism industry. Dubai’s rulers
      have sought to increase the city’s limited seafronts, and, in the absence
      of natural offshore islands, developers were encouraged to construct giant
      man-made islands off the coast of the city. The most famous of these is
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palm-Jumeirah" target="_blank"
        >Palm Jumeirah</a
      >, which has the shape of a palm tree. Others include the “World” islands,
      a cluster of small islands positioned to resemble a world map when viewed
      from above.
    </p>
    <h3>City site and layout</h3>
    <p>
      Dubai straddles a natural inlet called Dubai Creek on the southern shores
      of the Persian Gulf. For more than a century, the area was Dubai’s centre,
      because of the early city’s reliance on fishing, pearl diving, and
      maritime trade. Lining the creek are the oldest buildings in Dubai, most
      of which date from the 1960s and are rarely more than two stories in
      height. In the Bastakiyyah quarter, on the western shore of the creek,
      some much older buildings have been restored, and many of these feature
      the distinctive wind tower design that was imported by Persian merchants
      early in the 20th century.
      <br /><br /><br />
      The new city centre is a string of skyscrapers lining Sheikh Zayed Road.
      Notable among these are the Emirates Towers, which were built in the late
      1990s and early 2000s and which house a hotel and government offices.
      Close to Sheikh Zayed Road is the Dubai International Financial Centre,
      housed in a futuristic arch-shaped building, and the
      <a href="./aboutUs.html#burjKhalifa" target="_blank">Burj Khalifa</a>,
      which at the time of its official opening in 2010 was the world’s tallest
      building; it was named after the president of the United Arab Emirates and
      emir of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa ibn Zayed Al Nahyan. To the west of the
      skyscrapers lie several affluent suburbs, most of which house substantial
      villas. On their periphery lies the Burj al-ʿArab, a giant sail-shaped
      tower which is home to a luxury hotel. Farther west are new clusters of
      skyscrapers surrounding a man-made marina and several man-made lakes.
    </p>
    <h3>Climate</h3>
    <p>
      Like much of the Persian Gulf coastline, Dubai has a year-round hot
      climate. Humidity is high in the summer months and moderate the rest of
      the year. The coldest winter month is usually January, with lows of about
      15 °C (49 °F), while the hottest summer month is July, with highs of more
      than 40 °C (104 °F).
    </p>
    <h3>People</h3>
    <p>
      Dubai’s population has grown steadily over the past two centuries, from
      just a few thousand local inhabitants to well over two million. Most of
      the early population increases were due to merchants from neighbouring
      countries choosing to relocate to Dubai’s business-friendly environment.
      In the later 20th century the city’s construction boom led to a huge
      increase in the number of South Asian labourers and an influx of skilled
      expatriates from all over the world who play an important role in Dubai’s
      multi-sector economy. Expatriates in the city vastly outnumber native
      Emiratis. With the exception of the labourers, who are housed in work
      camps beyond the city limits, expatriates of various nationalities are
      spread across Dubai. Although Arabic is the official language, English is,
      in practice, the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/lingua-franca" target="_blank"
        >lingua franca.</a
      >
      <br /><br /><br />
      The local population is predominately Muslim, and most of the expatriate
      population is also Muslim, although there are significant Christian,
      Hindu, and Sikh communities. Given the tolerance of the ruling family
      toward non-Muslims and the city’s focus on business, the various
      communities coexist harmoniously, although there have been occasions when
      foreign residents have broken decency codes or drug-use prohibitions.
    </p>
    <!-- Economy -->
    <h1 id="economy">Economy</h1>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief, Dubai does not have an oil-based economy. The
      little oil wealth it did enjoy between the 1960s and the 1990s was used to
      enhance other sectors of its economy by building physical infrastructure.
      Trade remains at the core of Dubai’s economy, with the city operating two
      of the world’s largest ports and a busy international air cargo hub. The
      Jebel Ali
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/free-trade-zone"
        >free-trade zone</a
      >
      was established in the 1980s to attract industrial investment; activities
      based there include aluminum smelting, car manufacturing, and cement
      production.
    </p>
    <h3>Finance and other services</h3>
    <p>
      In the 21st century, activities meant to attract foreign investment have
      increased. Several free zones, like Jebel Ali, have been established that
      allow foreign companies to operate from Dubai without needing a local
      partner. These have been phenomenally successful, with the largest being
      home to more than 6,400 companies, many of which are European or North
      American. In the 1990s the city began positioning itself as a luxury
      tourist destination, spending a significant percentage of its GDP on
      grandiose resorts and attractions.
      <br /><br /><br />
      By 1998 Dubai had begun to permit foreign investors to purchase 99-year
      leases on properties, allowing the real estate sector to flourish. The
      Dubai International Financial Centre, which opened in 2006, is set aside
      in the UAE constitution as an independent legal jurisdiction; it operates
      under a separate commercial and civil framework based on English common
      law. This arrangement caters to international financial companies seeking
      to establish a presence in the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Middle-East" target="_blank"
        >Middle East</a
      >. These companies can use Dubai’s geographic location as a means to
      bridge the time zones between major financial hubs in Europe and East
      Asia. In 2009 the real estate and financial sectors crashed in the wake of
      the international credit crisis. A loan of $10 billion from Abu Dhabi
      helped Dubai avoid defaulting on its obligations, and the real estate
      market soon recovered.
    </p>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>
      With wide highways, a hot climate, and a year-round reliance on
      air-conditioning, Dubai is not a welcoming city for pedestrians, so
      vehicle traffic can be extremely intense. However, in the early 21st
      century, new bridges, roads, and a fully automated, driverless metro rail
      system have eased the frustrations of moving around the city. Tourism has
      been greatly enhanced by the Dubai-owned airline, Emirates, which operates
      a large and modern fleet of aircraft.
    </p>
    <!--Administration and society  -->
    <h1 id="administrationAndSociety">Administration and society</h1>
    <h3>Government</h3>
    <p>
      Dubai Municipality is one of the largest government institutions in the
      country. It is managed by a director general who in turn is accountable to
      the chairman of Dubai Municipality, a member of the ruling family. The
      director general oversees six sectors and 34 departments, which employ
      about 11,000 people. The municipality not only manages services in the
      city but is a key driver of economic growth in the emirate.
    </p>
    <h3>Municipal services</h3>
    <p>
      Dubai’s electricity and water provisions have largely kept up with the
      city’s
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/science/population-growth"
        target="_blank"
        >population growth</a
      >, though a number of other services such as waste collection have been
      criticized for falling behind. Parks and public spaces have been
      extensively developed and maintained; the city increased its number of
      green areas substantially in the 2010s.
    </p>
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <p>
      For those residents with private medical insurance, health care in Dubai
      is generally of a high standard, with several private hospitals, including
      the American Hospital Dubai. For those without insurance, the government
      operates a number of additional hospitals.
    </p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      Education is divided between the private and public sectors. Public school
      is generally taught in Arabic, while most private schools and all
      universities teach in English. Two universities, the American University
      in Dubai (1995) and Zayed University (1998), enjoy good reputations
      locally. Most of the staff are expatriates, with a significant proportion
      being from North America.
